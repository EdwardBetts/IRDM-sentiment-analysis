## IRDM-sentiment-analysis

This repository is for the 2016 UCL Information Retrieval and Data Mining group coursework project.
Group members are:
Barnaby Brien
Henrik Ebenhag
Alexander Lilburn
Derek Lukacsko

Current ideas:
* Cluster tweets by location and time to identify events
    * retrieve common words in those tweets - wordcloud for events?
* Create search tool for finding topics in tweets and find top users who often tweet on that topic
    * use tool such as word2vec to also include related words in search
* Sentiment analysis tool (difficult due to lack of sentiment label)
