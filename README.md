## IRDM-sentiment-analysis

This repository is for the 2016 UCL Information Retrieval and Data Mining group coursework project.

Group members are:

1. Barnaby Brien
2. Henrik Ebenhag
3. Alexander Lilburn
4. Derek Lukacsko

Current project plan:

Analyse Twitter data to build a picture of what people are doing across London, when they're doing it, and how they feel about it.

* Build sentiment classifier using previously acquired datasets
* Cluster tweets by time and location
* Display Twitter activity graphically over a map of london
* Allow ability to change what day/month tweets are shown from
    * Show activity on a specific day in the past (ie. Saturday 18th July 2015 in Camden)
    * Show global activity (ie. Every Saturday in Camden) to give general idea of activity
* Display word cloud of tweets in a location
* Contextually colour words in cloud based on sentiment
